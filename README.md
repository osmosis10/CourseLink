# CourseLink
#### Author: Moses Lemma - Business Systems Analyst Student

## Description
CourseLink is a simple UI that automates certain tasks that are  
needlessly time consuming when preparing Employee Learn Course  
data to be uploaded to SAMI. CourseLink uses the following libraries
- Tkinter (For GUI)
- Openpyxl (For excel functions)
- PIL (For applying the icon.ico file for the app icon)
- Pyinstaller (To compile the executable)

## Output files ##
The results of the CourseLink will be exported to a courseUpdated.txt file, with a new file generated if any already exists.

Critical exceptions will be logged and outputed to a debug_log.txt.

## How to create executable ##
In order to generate the executable ensure you have [pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/) and [openpyxl](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/) installed on your machine. Afterwards:  
1. Navigate to working directory and open command line
2. attempt to run ```pyinstaller CourseLinkSRC.py``` note: If this fails you may have to use the path to pyinstaller itself ex. ```C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python312\site-packages\PyInstaller\__main__.py CourseLinkSRC.py```
